puedo ver la carta  
nosotros vemos los libros   
ellos ven a las nin√°s  
nosotros vimos  
yo le veia a menudo  
no he visto a nadie  
has visto la iglesia  
a quien viste  
no yo no la he visto.  

can I see the menu  
we see the books  
they see the children  
we saw  
I used to see him often  
I have not seen anybody  
Have you seen the church  
Whom did you see ?  
No I have not seen it.
