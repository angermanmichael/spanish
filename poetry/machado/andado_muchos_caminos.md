## I have walked many roads

I have walked many roads  
and opened many paths  
sailed over a hundred seas  
and tied up on hundred shores.

And everywhere I have seen   
people who dance and play  
when they can, and work   
their few feet of land.  

If they turn up somewhere,   
they never ask where they are.    
When they travel they ride  
on the back of an old mule.   

and don't know how to hurry  
even on a day of fiesta.   
Where there is wine they drink it,     
where there is no wine, cold water.  

They are good folks who live,  
labor, pass by and dream,   
and on a day like all of the others,   
they relax below the earth...

Antonio Machado (1903)
