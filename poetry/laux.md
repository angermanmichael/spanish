If we are fractured  
we are fractured  
like stars  
bred to shine  
in every direction,  
through any dimension,  
billions of years  
since and hence.

I shall not lament  
the human, not yet.  
There is something  
more to come, our hearts  
a gold mine  
not yet plumbed,  
an uncharted sea.

Nothing is gone forever.  
If we came from dust  
and will return to dust  
then we can find our way  
into anything.

What we are capable of  
is not yet known,  
and I praise us now,  
in advance.
