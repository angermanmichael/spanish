### Chapter 7

1909

As the train snaked from the high plateau down to the luxuriant tropics, a salty breeze pricked the girl's nostrils.  There it was. The ocean !

Veracruz was hot and humid.

Antonieta, Alicia and Antonio Rivas Mercado go off to Paris for him to complete the sculptors for his Independence monument.  While there he runs into Diego Rivera with whom he was friends back in Mexico and they talk about art and him going back to Mexico.

Antonieta is such a good ballerina that the teacher asks Antonio whether she can stay in Paris and study while they return to Mexico.  He says no, and probably portends a turning point in her life that would ultimately be her downfall.  Had she stayed in Paris and lived out her dream the story I am reading would not have been written, and or a very different story would have unfolded.

### Chapter 8

1910

Antonieta meets Albert Blair, who is 19 or 20 and is an American engineer.  He sits besides her at a luncheon hosted by Cristina for the family and the rest is history.

Dr. Vasquez Gomez comes to visit Beto and Antonio to try and get their support for Francisco I Madero who is running against the incumbent Porfirio Diaz.  Antonio declines and Beto signs the petition.  He tells the brothers that a revolution is brewing in Mexico.

### Chapter 9

Houghton, Michigan June 1910

The chapter starts out in Michigan at the college Albert was attending at the time called the [Houghton School of Mines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Technological_University) in [Houghton, Michigan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Houghton,+M%C3%ADchigan+49931/@47.1111245,-88.5967778,7z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4d50c830dcb62d85:0xbe72cbcecc04ef7d!8m2!3d47.1211331!4d-88.5694182)

It introduces Albert, post his meeting with Antonieta in the previous chapter along with Francisco Madero's two younger brothers, Raul and Julio Madero who were the ones who got Albert to go to Mexico initially in the previous chapter.  Albert decides to forego working for his father in the coal mines of Kentucky and instead decides to take a job in Vancouver, BC.  He is only there for a short time, and when he hears of a revolution in Mexico he quickly boards a train to LA and then onto San Antonio where he meets up with his college Fraternity brothers and room-mates.  He shows up with about $800 in cash, $200 of which was given to him by his father for Christmas.  In San Antonio he purchases a money belt, a gun, and the rest of the accoutrements of war.  We learn about San Antonio at that time.

### Chapter 10

April 3, 1911

This chapter climaxes with the events leading up to the
[Treaty of Ciudad Juarez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Ciudad_Ju%C3%A1rez). This chapter is told by Albert Blair, Antonieta's future husband.

The big battle in Juarez happens on May 6, 1911.

In this chapter and the previous one we are introduced to
[Pancho Villa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Villa)

### Chapter 11

1911

The chapter starts out with Antonieta sitting in a little park close to her house waiting for Sabina to come fetch her.  So there is a massive context switch here back to life at home from the war ravaged lands of the north and the Revolution.  Part I of the revolution is now over, Madero is in power and as the chapter wanes on he arrives back in Mexico City to big crowds and a parade in his honor.  Antonio gets word early in the chapter that President Porfirio Diaz has resigned on 25 May 1911.

More details in the chapter are that Antonieta becomes a woman as she has her first period when she wakes up in the morning and doesn't know what it is.  She thinks she is dying and bleeding to death only to have Sabina tell her she is ok.

The city of Queretaro was the last important stop before the capital.  They would reach an elevation of 10k feet before they began to drop into the Valley of Mexico City.

Albert tried to go see Antonieta at her house but the gate keeper turned him down twice, officially he was going to see Christina but she either did not remember or want to see an old student of Antonio.  Luck had it that it just did not work out.

June 1911

Diego Rivera comes to visit Antonio in his office and bring him 2 paintings as he is back from Europe.  He is still not a well known artist and is scraping by selling his paintings for peanuts.  Things are changing for Antonio post revolution, there are signs of unrest at the university which will lead to his ultimate ousting and dismissal by the students and administration.    

### Chapter 12

August 1912

So much time has passed as we now fast forward more than a year.  Christina tells Antonio she is going to Europe with Alicia.  She uses the excuse that Alicia has a boyfriend she doesn't like because he is a liberal all caught up in the politics of Madero.  Christina was more conservative and leaned to the right with Diaz so she didn't like the fact that her daughter's first real love and boyfriend was this type of a person.

Also, there are rumblings in the book that Christina has been having an affair with some man called Fernando ? and so going off to Europe will give her a chance to meet some other men and get out of her financial responsibilities with her family.  Her brother and other members are having money problems and so she mortgages two of Antonio's properties by faking his signature on the deed.  She, all in all, does not seem like a good person with very low integrity.  I got a hit of this from the very beginning of the book...

[Bernardo Reyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_Reyes) was causing a problem for Madero along with [Emiliano Zapata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Zapata) in the south.  There are references to these figures in the book, but not much detail has emerged as of yet.  This is good fodder, for me, to better understand the Mexican Revolution, all the moving parts, dates, and key people who played roles in this drama of the time.

Beto, Antonio's brother is talking to Alicia prior to their departure to Europe and says to her.

"Remember the only nobility that counts is personal integrity and valor"

Christina and Alicia leave for Europe.

"Antonieta watched the long black automobile go through the gates, turn left and disappear.  Somehow she knew that the house on Heroes Street would never be the same again."

December 1912

"The cry of the fruit vendor brought Antonieta and the cook to the carriage gate."  They get the fruit.

"With the air of a grande dame, Antonieta walked back up the driveway ahead of the burdened cook".  She was all haughty grace.

"Antonio grew accustomed to a household without Cristina and life without the academy, from which he had resigned at the end of the term.  Undefined burdens seemed to be slipping from his shoulders.  He sang loud in his bath"

His brother Luis has invited us all to spend Christmas at the hacienda.

They take the train to the hacienda and on the way Albert Blair just happens to be on the train going to Zacatecas as he is now manager of a silver mine up there.  This is probably a true story.  He reintroduces himself to Antonio.

Antonieta was happy that Albert had remembered her.

As they depart the train, Albert observes the family greet each other with the affectionate kisses and hugs so ingrained in Mexicans.  Yet they were guarded and reserved with strangers.  True aristocrats these.  The Revolution had not affected them, or their way of life.

For the rest of the chapter we have a story about Paco her cousin, and Antonieta and how they are attracted to each other and play with each other but nothing ever happens.

"Although Paco was 3 years older, he had teased and challenged her since she could remember.  I like him, Antonieta said haughtily."

The hacienda de San Felipe was 5 kilometers from the station.  It is not clear in this book where it is.  I looked on Google maps but am not sure I know the real or exact location.  It doesn't matter.

The rest of the chapter is about life on the ranch and meanderings of the family.

"Antonieta's last view of San Felipe was of the high adobe wall which protected the store, the bakery, the school and the little church of the village."

### Chapter 13

February 1913   
I added February 9 as it was the day General Reyes was killed.

Antonio and Antonieta awaken to the burst of fireworks.  The revolution was in full swing and the next few days would see Madero killed and lots of violence. Antonieta and her Japanese friend Iwa start heading back across town towards the Japanese embassy in the middle of a huge firestorm down on the Zocalo.

Iwa's father was informed that General Reyes was let out of prison and led an attack on the Palace.  He was killed.  President Madero has just arrived at the Palace.

At this time period in history there are telephones and Antonieta speaks to her father Antonio and they decide that she should stay at Iwa's house, the Japanese embassy and wait it out.  Eventually Antonieta comes up with a plan to signal back and forth between her house and Iwa's house via the towers at both sites.

The American Ambassador, Henry Lane Wilson, was calling an emergency meeting of all ministers and representatives of Foreign nations to a meeting at the American Embassy at four in the afternoon.  Mr. Wilson was dean of the diplomatic corps and the only one with status of Ambassador.
