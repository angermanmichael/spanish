### Chapter 7

1909

As the train snaked from the high plateau down to the luxuriant tropics, a salty breeze pricked the girl's nostrils.  There it was. The ocean !

Veracruz was hot and humid.

Antonieta, Alicia and Antonio Rivas Mercado go off to Paris for him to complete the sculptors for his Independence monument.  While there he runs into Diego Rivera with whom he was friends back in Mexico and they talk about art and him going back to Mexico.

Antonieta is such a good ballerina that the teacher asks Antonio whether she can stay in Paris and study while they return to Mexico.  He says no, and probably portends a turning point in her life that would ultimately be her downfall.  Had she stayed in Paris and lived out her dream the story I am reading would not have been written, and or a very different story would have unfolded.

Antonieta meets Albert Blair, who is 19 or 20 and is an American engineer.  He sits besides her at a luncheon hosted by Cristina for the family and the rest is history.

Dr. Vasquez Gomez comes to visit Beto and Antonio to try and get their support for Francisco I Madero who is running against the incumbent Porfirio Diaz.  Antonio declines and Beto signs the petition.  He tells the brothers that a revolution is brewing in Mexico.

The chapter starts out in Michigan at the college Albert was attending at the time called the [Houghton School of Mines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Technological_University) in [Houghton, Michigan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Houghton,+M%C3%ADchigan+49931/@47.1111245,-88.5967778,7z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4d50c830dcb62d85:0xbe72cbcecc04ef7d!8m2!3d47.1211331!4d-88.5694182)

It introduces Albert, post his meeting with Antonieta in the previous chapter along with Francisco Madero's two younger brothers, Raul and Julio Madero who were the ones who got Albert to go to Mexico initially in the previous chapter.  Albert decides to forego working for his father in the coal mines of Kentucky and instead decides to take a job in Vancouver, BC.  He is only there for a short time, and when he hears of a revolution in Mexico he quickly boards a train to LA and then onto San Antonio where he meets up with his college Fraternity brothers and room-mates.  He shows up with about $800 in cash, $200 of which was given to him by his father for Christmas.  In San Antonio he purchases a money belt, a gun, and the rest of the accoutrements of war.  We learn about San Antonio at that time.
