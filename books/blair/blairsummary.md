As the train snaked from the high plateau down to the luxuriant tropics, a salty breeze pricked the girl's nostrils.  There it was. The ocean !

Veracruz was hot and humid.

Antonieta, Alicia and Antonio Rivas Mercado go off to Paris for him to complete the sculptors for his Independence monument.  While there he runs into Diego Rivera with whom he was friends back in Mexico and they talk about art and him going back to Mexico.

Antonieta is such a good ballerina that the teacher asks Antonio whether she can stay in Paris and study while they return to Mexico.  He says no, and probably portends a turning point in her life that would ultimately be her downfall.  Had she stayed in Paris and lived out her dream the story I am reading would not have been written, and or a very different story would have unfolded.
