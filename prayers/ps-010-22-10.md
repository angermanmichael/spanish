The earth was warm under me,  
and warm as I crumbled it through my fingers.  
Queer little red bugs came out  
and moved in slow squadrons around me.  
Their backs were polished vermilion, with black spots.  
I kept as still as I could.  
Nothing happened.  
I did not expect anything to happen.  
I was something that lay under the sun and felt it,  
like the pumpkins,  
and I did not want to be anything more.  
I was entirely happy.  
Perhaps we feel like that when we die  
and become a part of something entire,  
whether it is sun and air,  
or goodness and knowledge.  
At any rate, that is happiness;  
to be dissolved into something complete and great.  
When it comes to one,  
it comes as naturally as sleep.
