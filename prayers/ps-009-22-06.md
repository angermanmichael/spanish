QUIZÁS, QUIZÁS, QUIZÁS   
(written by Osvaldo Farrés, Cuba, 1947)

Siempre que te pregunto  
Que, cuándo, cómo y dónde  
Tú siempre me respondes  
Quizás, quizás, quizás

Y así pasan los días  
Y yo, desesperando  
Y tú, tú contestando  
Quizás, quizás, quizás

Estás perdiendo el tiempo  
Pensando, pensando  
Por lo que más tú quieras   
Hasta cuándo? Hasta cuándo?

Y así pasan los días  
Y yo, desesperando  
Y tú, tú contestando  
Quizás, quizás, quizás

Estás perdiendo el tiempo  
Pensando, pensando  
Por lo que más tú quieras  
Hasta cuándo? Hasta cuándo?

Y así pasan los días  
Y yo, desesperando  
Y tú, tú contestando  
Quizás, quizás, quizás

Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps  
English translation of original Spanish lyrics


I am always asking you  
When, how and where  
You always tell me  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

The days pass this way  
And I am despairing  
And you, you always answer  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

You are wasting time  
Thinking, thinking  
That which you want most  
Until when? Until when?

The days pass this way  
And I am despairing  
And you, you always answer  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

You are wasting time  
Thinking, thinking  
That which you want most  
Until when? Until when?

The days pass this way  
And I am despairing  
And you, you always answer  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps  
English lyrics

You won't admit you love me and so  
How am I ever to know  
You only tell me  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

A million times I ask you and then  
I ask you over again  
You only answer  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

If you can't make your mind up  
We'll never get started  
And I don't want to wind up  
Being parted, broken hearted

So if you really love me say, "yes"  
But if you don't, dear, confess  
And please don't tell me  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

If you can't make your mind up  
We'll never get started  
And I don't want to wind up  
Being parted, broken hearted

So if you really love me say, "yes"  
But if you don't, dear, confess  
And please don't tell me  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
