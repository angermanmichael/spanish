“Caminante, son tus huellas  
el camino y nada más;  
Caminante, no hay camino,  
se hace camino al andar.  

Al andar se hace el camino,  
y al volver la vista atrás  
se ve la senda que nunca  
se ha de volver a pisar.  
Caminante, no hay camino  
sino estelas en la mar.”


Traveler, your footprints  
are the only road, nothing else.  
Traveler, there is no road;  
you make your own path as you walk.

As you walk, you make your own road,  
and when you look back  
you see the path  
you will never travel again.  
Traveler, there is no road;  
only a ship's wake on the sea.

Walker, your footsteps  
are the road, and nothing more.  
Walker, there is no road,  
the road is made by walking.

Walking you make the road,  
and turning to look behind  
you see the path you never  
again will step upon.  
Walker, there is no road,  
only foam trails on the sea.
